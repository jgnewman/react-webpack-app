# react-webpack-app
Spin up a boilerplate app using React, Webpack, and Babel.

This is mainly just for me so I don't have to write a bunch of boilerplate all the time. But, who knows, you may find it useful as well.

# How

Create a folder for your project, `cd` into it, and `npm init` that sucker.

Next, install this tool via `npm install --save-dev react-webpack-app@https://github.com/jgnewman/react-webpack-app.git`

Then run it via `node node_modules/react-webpack-app`.

Answer a couple questions and you're done!

## IMPORTANT!

You need to run this **BEFORE** doing anything else. Otherwise you run the risk of having it overwrite package.json scripts as well as other files and directories.
